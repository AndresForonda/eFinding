[Info  - 4:03:01 PM] ESLint server is running.
[Info  - 4:03:02 PM] 
Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /srv/http/scripts/controllers/users-list.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder http
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder http by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
